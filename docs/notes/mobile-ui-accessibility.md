# Mobile UI accessibility thoughts

Thinking about optimizing UI for mobile. One thing is some of these reps are old, need to wear glasses to read fine print etc. tooling around with practical solutions.

Ideas to explore:
- Larger base font-size and minimum tap sizes
- High-contrast theme toggle
- Zoom-friendly layouts (no overflow traps)
- Optional “simplified mode” with bigger controls
- Voice-friendly flows / reduced typing
